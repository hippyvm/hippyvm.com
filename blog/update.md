A quick update from HippyVM to say that project is doing well and what's cool (or rather hot) for us.


Conferences
-----------
[Maciej Fija≈Çkowski](https://twitter.com/fijall) our technical lead, and "know all the things" guy, 
will be talking at [Brno PHP Conference 2014](https://www.brnophp.cz/conference-2014), 
so if you want to know what HippyVM is and how we develop it, grab a ticket. 
A few other people from HippyVM team might be there as well. 
Also please [let us know](https://twitter.com/hippyvm) if we should send Maciej elsewhere. 


Project Roadmap
---------------

We're still in our beta phase, and under heavy development.
Our most recent priorities stands for few things:

**Well known PHP projects**: Full (or nearly full) functionality for these popular PHP projects, 
which we've put a lot of effort/focus on: [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki),
and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).   

**Performance**: We're doing very well here. In some areas we are even a bit ahead of both HHVM and PHP. Still there's lots of room for improvements - and we are on it!

**Completeness**: Here HippyVM is still behind PHP, we are missing a few functions/classes here and there. 
Since we are really small team, it'll take a while, but we're working hard to get there!


Github
------
After hearing a lot of calls to move the project to Github as an open source,
we decided to do it. HippyVM is running inside it's own [organization](https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm),
where you'll find all things related to the project and [HippyVM](https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm)'s
source.  We've also decided to switch from BuildBot to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/hippyvm/hippyvm). 
Several extensions will stay proprietary for the time being, including a FastCGI server. 
We're looking into a business models of selling a commercial version of HippyVM


Contributors
------------
This one is related to all above. Since HippyVM from now on is open-sourced,
and a small team like us needs as much help as we can get, you are more than welcome to join.
Have a look inside our code base, it doesn't look that scary. ;-)
Please visit us on IRC [#hippyvm@freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hippyvm),
ask a question, open Github [issue](https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm/issues),
or just simply send us an email at [contact@hippyvm.com](mailto:contact@hippyvm.com).


Have a productive Monday,

Sebastian and HippyVM team.
